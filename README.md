What it Does:
The program is as simple as it looks, first the user is asked what their first name is. After an input has been received, the program again prompts the use asking for their last name this time, and then it prints out to the user, Hello (first name) (last name).

How to Use it:
In order to use our program, first download the file named somethingTM.ipynb. From there open up anything that can run an ipynb (like JupterLab), and run the code as you would any other code. Since the software will automatically prompt you for your name, all you need to do is run it and respond to the prompts.

How to Contribute:
First fork the project, adding a description if you so desire. Now that the fork is created, look above the list of files, and click on the green code button. Copy the URL for the repository. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory. Type git clone and paste the earlier copied URL. Now make your changes and use git add ., git commit, and git push to make your changes locally. The last step to contributing to this project is making a pull request. To do that, go back to the GitHub repository, and click contribute and open a pull request. Then click create pull request, and await approval for your code.
